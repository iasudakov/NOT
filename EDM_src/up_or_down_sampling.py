  r"""Downsample a batch of 2D images with the given filter.

    Accepts a batch of 2D images of the shape `[N, C, H, W]` or `[N, H, W, C]`
    and downsamples each image with the given filter. The filter is normalized
    so that
    if the input pixels are constant, they will be scaled by the specified
    `gain`.
    Pixels outside the image are assumed to be zero, and the filter is padded
    with
    zeros so that its shape is a multiple of the downsampling factor.
    Args:
        x:            Input tensor of the shape `[N, C, H, W]` or `[N, H, W,
          C]`.
        k:            FIR filter of the shape `[firH, firW]` or `[firN]`
          (separable). The default is `[1] * factor`, which corresponds to
          average pooling.
        factor:       Integer downsampling factor (default: 2).
        gain:         Scaling factor for signal magnitude (default: 1.0).

    Returns:
        Tensor of the shape `[N, C, H // factor, W // factor]`
